# Rubik's Cube Solver
This project is divided into 3 parts:
1. Modeling a 3x3 Rubik's Cube in 3 different ways: using 1d array, using 3d array and using 6 64-bit integers
2. Modeling the problem of solving the Rubik's cube as a graph problem by using each state of a Rubik's cube as a node and each operation as an edge. We try to find the shortest path between the initial and final state using BFS, DFS and IDDFS.
3. Implementing Korf's algorithm to solve the Rubik's Cube. This is based on the research paper: https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos402/papers/korfrubik.pdf

To run this locally:
1. Create a local copy of the repository
2. Compile and run main.cpp in the local compiler or IDE.

Thank You!
